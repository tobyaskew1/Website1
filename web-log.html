        <h1>Site Log</h1>   
        <p>This is where I will log all the changes made to the Website and also the date that it was changed. This is more for personal reference!</p>
        <h2>23/01/2020</h2>
        <list>
            <p>This is when the website was established. I added basic pages to the website including the "Welcome" page and also the "Site Log" page.</p>
