            <h2>What is this website all about?</h2>
        <p>This is my first practice website. I have started to read a book on HTML, and that is why I am making this website, for revision I suppose! I am going to try and make as much of this website from memory as I can! <br> 
            The book I am reading is technically 2 books, but I am reading the first of the 2 for now. It is on HTML and CSS (obviously) and I am trying to learn how to make a fully functioning website. <br>
            The book is by Jon Duckett and can be found on Amazon here: 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=html+book&qid=1579800576&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Book</a> </p>
        <p>This website will be full of random bits and bobs and a lot of stock photos (sorry about that!). <br> 
                There will be links to different things here and there and also a list of things that have been changed with the dates they where changed. Just for personal reference!</p>
        <p>This is page 1 of, well I don't know how many just yet and website 1 of many so that's it's name: Website No.1. </p>
        <p>I have a short history with web development, I have made 2 websites before. Sort of makes the name of this website a bit backwards though... <br>
            My very first website was, well pretty bad to be kind. My second website was better and I suppose a lot more relevent to this one. More of a: This is what I can do right now. <br>
            But then summer came and I took a break from coding to go outside (and play golf!) while the weather was hot! Resulting in me forgetting everything! So here we are! <br>
             Pictures to the previous websites will be shown below!</p>
